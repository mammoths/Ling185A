 -- This gives the test cases but it's not correct because we don't want to nub everything.

-- follows checks if the first element of the head of trans matches a, if so return the snd element of x. 
-- if not, continue iterating on the rest of trans.

-- MORE EXAMPLE USAGE:

-- forward g2 2 "very"
-- => [["very","very","very"],["very","very","fat"],["very","fat","cat"],
--    ["very","very"],["very","fat"]]

-- follows gives us the list of transitionable items from x. 
-- forward gives us an iter, x, grammar, and returns
-- ret: follows list, plus follows + following THAT list. "who are my followers following."

occurrences 0 r = One 
occurrences n r = Concat (occurrences (n-1) r) (r) 

-- In the code it seems a bit unintuitive that 0 occurrences returns One, 
-- However, the test seems to be correct.
-- denotation (occurrences 1 (Lit 'c')) => ["c"]
-- denotation (occurrences 0 (Lit 'c')) => [""], which is equivalent to zero occurrences of One C. .
-- However, concatenation with the empty list (Zero) yields the empty list.
